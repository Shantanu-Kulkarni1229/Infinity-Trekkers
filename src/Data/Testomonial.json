Safety precautions were taken. Trekmates were so helpful and jolly. Transportation was pretty good in remote region.Trek leaders and technical staff were Friendly and keeps everyone motivated through out trek, special thanks to Rishikesh as He was so calm and composed in every situation. Suggestion- it would be great if stay point would have been Kulang as there was more water availability and larger platue on Kulang fort which is comfortable for camping. Food was super tasty and should be distributed equally to avoid shortage.",
